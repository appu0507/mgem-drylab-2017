-interpret tpot output when finished

-Figure out how to normalize fitness scores from actual read data

-Build ML model to predict fitness score from sequence

-Train model on aptamer read data

-test ML model (train on half round 9 ALS data, verify with other half of round 9 data)

-compare output of training on round 10 data to round 11 data, and see if it produces similar increases in fitness after 1 generation (in silico vs. in vitro comparison)

-Integrated ML model as fitness function for GA
