-Figure out which NN model to build
-Build ML model to predict fitness score from sequence
-Figure out how to normalize fitness scores from actual read data
-Format read data appropriately (tab-delimited files with sequences and fitness scores in each colum)
-Train model on aptamer read data
-test ML model (train on half round 9 ALS data, verify with other half of round 9 data)
-compare output of training on round 10 data to round 11 data, and see if it produces similar increases in fitness after 1 generation (in silico vs. in vitro comparison)
-Integrated ML model as fitness function for GA
